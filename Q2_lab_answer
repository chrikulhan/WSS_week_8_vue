What causes it, and how do you fix it?  Write an answer in your own words.

**The vue warning message means that there is something
defined in the <div id="app"> section that was not addressed
in the let app = Vue.createApp({ section.

Basically, the template was created in the html portion, but
the guts weren't properly directed in the vue.js portion.
